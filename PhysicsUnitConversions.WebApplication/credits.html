<h2>Donations</h2>

<p>It costs money to keep a website online. This website has no adverts on it; there are no annoying pop-ups and side-bars; you don't have to sign in; and nothing's hidden behind a paywall. This website has been designed to be as useful and minimalistic as possible. But it still costs money to keep the website online.</p>

<p>If you like this website, and you'd like to build a better internet that isn't filled with annoying adverts or companies trying to sell your data, consider donating to keep this website online. This website currently costs about £5.00 per month to keep online. If only 10 people donated 50p per month, the website could stay online indefinitely.</p>
